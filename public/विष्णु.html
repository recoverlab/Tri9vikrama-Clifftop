            This “Ombudsmanship” authority record may be treated as being its own expressive origin from which qualities of derivation are created.

            As <span style="font-weight: bold">विष्णु</span>, or <span style="font-weight: bold" property="hasAppellation">Viṣṇu</span>, is the soul or work within this expression of my ombudsmanship interest, from which further schemata and so forth might develop, this authority record is almost unique in its referencing of the bibliographic world beyond. The bibliographic relationships this record has with other few records is mostly what the content of its intention is. Attributes can be described at the <a href="https://gitlab.com/a665566/clifftop/wikis/विष्णु">next level</a> of classification, while referential focus on the entities their selves is given one level beyond that.
            <br /><br />
            The Vedic god Viṣṇu is the soul whose intelligence enlivens truest love. The word “love” itself maintains its own record-worthiness, but together with his feminine goddess <a href="https://ombudsmanship.gitlab.io/clifftop/लक्ष्मी.html">लक्ष्मी</a> (Lakṣmī), Viṣṇu is the primary god in this type of three-dimensional universe within which we presently live. Lakṣmī’s relationship with him is the strength of love itself, so her record has been linked from this one, as is his own identification with the vertically adjacent god <a href="https://ombudsmanship.gitlab.io/clifftop/चन्द्र.html">चन्द्र</a> (Candra).
            <br /><br />
            Trans-Venusian identifications can be referenced from other records, as can the details of bibliographic work be managed in connection with Viṣṇu’s role. Any other aspects of ombudsmanship can likewise be his to pursue and develop and explain. Her place in this exact origin of authoritative expression is gratia.
