            This “Ombudsmanship” authority record may be treated as being its own expressive origin from which qualities of derivation are created.

            As <span style="font-weight: bold">लक्ष्मी</span>, or <span style="font-weight: bold" property="hasAppellation">Lakṣmī</span>, is the very first expression of my ombudsmanship interest, from which further schemata and so forth might develop, this authority record may be unique in its referencing of the bibliographic world beyond. The bibliographic relationships this record has with other few records is mostly what the content of its intention is. Attributes can be described at the next level of classification, focus on the entities their selves one level beyond that.

            The Vedic goddess Lakṣmī is the life within the voice of what love truly is. The word “love” itself is given its own record, but together with her masculine god विष्णु, or Viṣṇu, she is the primary love goddess within this type of three-dimensional universe within which we presently live.
