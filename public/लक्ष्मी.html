            <span style="font-weight: bold">लक्ष्मी</span>, or <span style="font-weight: bold" property="hasAppellation">Lakṣmī</span>, is helping me with the presentation of an authority record to levels of audience interest. I'm initially just building a type of backbone, looking to learn how to use Git-repositories for the logging of the web page development process. This is after some time I've spent getting used to the semantics of Referata wikiing in connection with IFLA vocabulary. I've been working with the FANDOM (previously Wikia) environment for years, and getting better at working my own creativity there as a foundation for this stage of my learning process. And, I'd love to someday improve my ability to occasionally contribute to Wikipedia in a fashion that has value to its type of audience.
