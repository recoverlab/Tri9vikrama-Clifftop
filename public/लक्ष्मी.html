            <span style="font-weight: bold; text-align: justify">लक्ष्मी</span>, or <span style="font-weight: bold" property="hasAppellation">Lakṣmī</span>, is helping me with the presentation of an authority record to levels of audience interest. I'm initially just building a type of backbone, looking to learn how to use Git-repositories for the logging of the web page development process. This is after some time I've spent getting used to the semantics of Referata wikiing in connection with IFLA vocabulary. I've been working with the FANDOM (previously Wikia) environment for years, and getting better at working my own creativity there as a foundation for this stage of my learning process. And, I'd love to someday improve my ability to occasionally contribute to Wikipedia in a fashion that has value to its type of audience.
            <br /><br />
            My opinion so far is that GitLab is possibly a safest type of place for me to just write freely. Wikipedia and other intermediary levels of audience have other agendas, where this seems to be an environment where people know what they're doing and don't have much reason to complain about what each other might be doing if it isn't interfering. FANDOM is pretty lenient, I've found through years of experimenting, but there's a subtle vibe that expects more than I am trying to answer to. Their purpose is very Web 2.0, which I love, but I want to really learn and get into the nuts and bolts of whatever it is I'm doing.
            <br /><br />
            Semantic wikiing with Referata is very new to me, and it looks like a vast world in and of itself, with so much room for progress anywhere I'm looking to take my own wikiing. However, part of how I got there was by making (again subtle) deals with the bibliography community, which would like to clean up the general “voices” situation in this dimension. IFLA is the cleanest I've found, and I look forward to a lot of progress with them, but work is work, even if its LRM-E2 entity Work, “the intellectual or artistic content of a distinct creation” and “an abstract entity that permits the grouping of expressions that are considered functional equivalents or near equivalents,” and so forth.
            <br /><br />
            I'd like to really slow down, if I can, and get underneath whatever moves me, so that I can become my own mover better than I've been yet. I'm beginning to recognize a greater picture of what life has in store for me, and I'd like to improve my answer to that. Making something of myself in the backbone of any expressions and creativity I'll be coming up with on the Internet sounds like the right way to go.
