            Exactly what is Trivikrama’s role? I'm drawing from three places where I've made notes: <a href="http://scarecrow.referata.com/wiki/User:Tri9vikrama/note">here</a>, <a href="https://clifftop-ombudsmanship.github.io/GOt-CHa/">here</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/Tri9vikrama/Scarecrow/wiki/gratia">here</a>. What I'm coming up with of a simple definition is this: “answers to the gratia that Ἀπόλλων’s ombudsmanship is ensuring, is learning how Git repository version control can be used to ensure ius, and gives provision of reference to sanctum through semantic wikiing.”
            <br /><br />
            How do the terms I'm using pertain to standards of priority and design and all that? <span style="font-style: italic">Nomen</span> is a well-used standard that I for my own work am associating with the development of third level bibliography, it having been given strength of utility already by fourth level for such purpose. <span style="font-style: italic">Sanctum</span> is a term I began to use when I was an AMORC Rosicrucian, and it has to do with the given existence of some type of facility by third level bibliography and the like for a milder second level agenda.
            <br /><br />
            The three standard second level agendas are: Vaiṣṇavism (simple and Oriental), legislation (medial), and education (complex and Occidental). <span style="font-style: italic">Sanctum</span> can be like <span style="font-style: italic">nomen</span> if its possessor chooses to use it for such, but it means that, be it in some fashion that pertains to the scope of what Vaiṣṇavism is, be it by legislation of some sort, be it that its possessor has received an education teaching them the appropriate “how-to,” some type of mildness is protected by which you can evaluate and/or re-evaluate what you are making of your life. <span style="font-style: italic">Sanctum</span> might not be all there is to being a strong speaker, but it means your given facility is spoken for by the appropriate level of strength, and so it pertains exactly to the idea of “rights.”
            <br /><br />
            My own preference is very noticeable, in how much Sanskrit I use theistically (and theurgically), but the translations are meaningful. Legislation works well with education, and so does Vaiṣṇavism work well with legislation. Corruption, if found in any of these three types of sanctum, will destroy the utility and border on the destruction of the good “<span style="font-style: italic">nomen</span>” of its lifestyle. Certainly, goodness is not what's left if desecration by corruption has been the fate of an unhappy situation.
            <br /><br />
            The term <span style="font-style: italic">ius</span> means “justice,” and there seem to be two divisions of such. Governmental (state) and ecclesiastical (church) styles of protecting justice, or justification, together form the standard duality. Each has their own way of identifying or relating with Orient, Medium, and Occident. Where <span style="font-style: italic">nomen</span> is an entitlement possessed by an entity such as <span style="font-style: italic">work</span> or <span style="font-style: italic">person</span> or any <span style="font-style: italic">res</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic">sanctum</span> is spoken for by the librarian or legislator or guru, <span style="font-style: italic">ius</span> speaks for itself; it does its own work and defines its own persona and values.
            <br /><br />
            <span style="font-style: italic">Gratia</span> is the strongest level of speech, and is more truly humanitarian in its gift of participation with the power of facilitating place and role in this world. However, the expectation of that term’s expression of purpose through Trivikrama’s specific work here would exceed the apparent relativities amongst facilitative agents. Ἀπόλλων, who also uses the nomen Rāma Viṣṇu Candra, oversees the qualification of gratia, and so Trivikrama will simply be the one who at his level of this organization shares the work here of “ensuring ius.”
