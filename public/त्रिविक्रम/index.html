            Exactly what is Trivikrama’s role? I'm drawing from three places where I've made notes: <a href="http://scarecrow.referata.com/wiki/User:Tri9vikrama/note">here</a>, <a href="https://clifftop-ombudsmanship.github.io/GOt-CHa/">here</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/Tri9vikrama/Scarecrow/wiki/gratia">here</a>. What I'm coming up with of a simple definition is this: “answers to the gratia that Ἀπόλλων’s ombudsmanship is ensuring, is learning how Git repository version control can be used to ensure ius, and gives provision of reference to sanctum through semantic wikiing.”
            <br /><br />
            How do the terms I'm using pertain to standards of priority and design and all that? <span style="font-style: italic">Nomen</span> is a well-used standard that I for my own work am associating with the development of third level bibliography, it having been given strength of utility already by fourth level for such purpose. <span style="font-style: italic">Sanctum</span> is a term I began to use when I was an AMORC Rosicrucian, and it has to do with the given existence of some type of facility by third level bibliography and the like for a milder second level agenda.
            <br /><br />
            The three standard second level agendas are: Vaiṣṇavism (simple and oriental), legislation (medial), and education (complex and occidental). <span style="font-style: italic">Sanctum</span> can be like <span style="font-style: italic">nomen</span> if its possessor chooses to use it for such, but it means that, be it in some fashion that pertains to the scope of what Vaiṣṇavism is, be it by legislation of some sort, be it that its possessor has received an education teaching them the appropriate “how-to,” some type of mildness is protected by which you can evaluate and/or re-evaluate what you are making of your life.
