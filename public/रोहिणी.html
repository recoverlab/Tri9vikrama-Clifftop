            This “Ombudsmanship” authority record may be treated as being its own expressive origin from which qualities of derivation are created.

            As <span style="font-weight: bold">रोहिणी</span>, or <span style="font-weight: bold" property="hasAppellation">Rohiṇī</span>, is a very simple secondary expression of my ombudsmanship interest, from which further schemata and so forth might develop, this authority record is almost unique in its referencing of the bibliographic world beyond. The bibliographic relationships this record has with other few records is mostly what the content of its intention is. Attributes can be described at the <a href="https://gitlab.com/a665566/clifftop/wikis/रोहिणी">next level</a> of classification, while referential focus on the entities their selves is given one level beyond that.

            The Vedic goddess Rohiṇī is the heart of truest love. She gives, to her masculine god <a href="https://ombudsmanship.gitlab.io/clifftop/चन्द्र.html">चन्द्र</a> (Candra), of her own superlative quality of attractiveness to draw his loving attention from anywhere he may have tried to wander, and gives their affair lasting resolve in monogamous union. Rohiṇī is the favorite love goddess in our type of three-dimensional universe, and is also known as the <span style="font-style: italic">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</span> goddess Sehanine Moonbow. Her relationship with Corellon Larethian (Candra) is stronger than integral, and so his record has been linked from this one, as is her own identification with the vertically adjacent goddesses <a href="">L</a> and <a href="https://ombudsmanship.gitlab.io/clifftop/सरस्वती.html">सरस्वती</a> (Sarasvatī).

            Trans-Venusian identifications can be referenced from other records, as can the details of bibliographic work be managed in connection with Viṣṇu’s role. Any other aspects of ombudsmanship can likewise be his to pursue and develop and explain. Her place in this exact origin of authoritative expression is gratia.
