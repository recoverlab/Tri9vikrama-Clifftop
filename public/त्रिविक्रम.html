            As <span style="font-weight: bold">त्रिविक्रम</span>, or <span style="font-weight: bold" property="hasAppellation">Trivikrama</span>, is the humanist aspect of soul or work within this expression of my ombudsmanship interest, from which further schemata and so forth might develop, this authority record is almost unique in its referencing of the bibliographic world beyond. The bibliographic relationships this record has with other few records is mostly what the content of its intention is. Attributes can be described at the <a href="https://gitlab.com/a665566/clifftop/wikis/त्रिविक्रम">next level</a> of classification, while referential focus on the entities their selves is given one level beyond that.
            <br /><br />
            Trivikrama is a name for वामन (Vāmana), the divine manifestation of the brahminical strength of Vedic god Viṣṇu. This authority record should identify some trans-Venusian mythology, and will be a prime address for numerous details of bibliographic work in accordance with his role as Viṣṇu. Any such aspects of this ombudsmanship will likely be his to pursue and develop and explain.
