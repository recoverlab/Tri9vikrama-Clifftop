            I'm slowly developing my sense of how I want to organize my learning process. The main two sites I'm working with are this one (GitLab) and Referata. Bibliographic vocabulary in connection with RDFa and semantic wikiing are my main interest presently.
            <br /><br />
            I'm thinking of four levels of work with metadata, but mostly the third and fourth. I think Referata wikiing is pretty good for the third (think dimensional space, such as where in a library to shelve a book), but GitLab has a great way of tracking the metadata of processing through that fourth dimension of time. I haven't begun to systematize my own use of it well yet; Im simply adjusting to its environment still.
            <br /><hr style="width: 61.8%" /><br />
            Here's how I think. You, the viewing audience, are reading of these words what is probably a manifestation of the expression that I have (LRM-R5 WORK was created by AGENT) been working on. In my work, I may call these (LRM-R2 WORK is realized through EXPRESSION) words an expression, and I am (LRM-R6 EXPRESSION was created by AGENT) correct. What you call the words you are reading, which have been carried to you (LRM-R3 EXPRESSION is embodied in MANIFESTATION) through whatever media (LRM-R7 MANIFESTATION was created by AGENT, in this case the agent being the media provider) you linked to or otherwise used to bring said manifestation to where you are from where my expression was introduced into my own connective media, that's up to you. But the words you are reading may often “speak” of theirselves as being what expression is.
            <br /><br />
            If I'm using a semantic wiki like Referata, I can choose any words I like for properties and values, but if I'm learning to add the Resource Description Framework in Attributes (RDFa) specification to my HTML, I might like using the vocabulary already published by the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA). As they've provided a downloadable <span style="font-style: italic">Transition Mappings</span> document on their website, I can work with both their namespace vocabulary and their Library Reference Model elements and definitions. I may give some explanations with my work, but if I make good use of these accepted bibliographic standards, the reader can research easily to gain a better knowledge of what I think I mean.
