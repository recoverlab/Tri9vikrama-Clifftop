            I'm slowly developing my sense of how I want to organize my learning process. The main two sites I'm working with are this one (GitLab) and Referata. Bibliographic vocabulary in connection with RDFa and semantic wikiing are my main interest presently.
            <br /><br />
            I'm thinking of four levels of work with metadata, but mostly the third and fourth. I think Referata wikiing is pretty good for the third (think dimensional space, such as where in a library to shelve a book), but GitLab has a great way of tracking the metadata of processing through that fourth dimension of time. I haven't begun to systematize my own use of it well yet; Im just getting used to the environment still.
